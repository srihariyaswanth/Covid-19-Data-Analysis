This mini-project analyzes the global spread of COVID-19 using confirmed case data along with a cross-analysis of world happiness indicators.
Here are the key insights drawn from the analysis:
üìä COVID-19 Spread Analysis
The dataset includes confirmed COVID-19 cases from January to April 2020 for multiple countries.

The highest daily infection rates (spikes) were extracted using the .diff().max() function to understand peak infection moments.

Countries like Italy, India, and China were visualized over time to compare their outbreak trajectories.

India's maximum daily increase and cumulative increase were compared with other countries to assess its relative outbreak severity.

üåç Cross-Analysis with Happiness Index
The COVID-19 infection data was merged with the World Happiness Report, focusing on metrics like:
GDP per capita
Social support
Healthy life expectancy
Freedom to make life choices

A correlation analysis and scatterplots were used to explore the relationship between a country's happiness metrics and its COVID-19 infection rate.

It was found that:

GDP per capita and life expectancy have a negative correlation with peak COVID-19 infection rates.

This suggests that countries with better economic conditions and healthcare infrastructure may have been better equipped to manage the outbreak.

Conclusion
Countries with stronger economies and public health systems generally experienced lower peak infection rates, potentially due to better prevention and containment strategies.
This project showcases how combining pandemic data with socioeconomic indicators can offer insights into global health resilience.
Data visualization and exploratory data analysis were performed using pandas, seaborn,pyplot and matplotlib.
